# pta-python

A Python implementation of the Plum Tree Algorithm (PTA).

## Setup

Clone the `pta-python` repository on your machine.

Open a `PowerShell` terminal in the `pta-python` repository.

Create a virtual environment `.venv`:

    python -m venv .venv

Activate the virtual environment `.venv`:

    .venv\Scripts\activate

Install the requirements:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the simulator using the command:

    python main.py

The virtual environment `.venv` can be deactivated as follows:

    deactivate
